(1, 'Udon', 'A type of noodle made from wheat that originated in Japan.' ,'
Originating from Japan, udon noodles are one of the most popular types of noodles in
Taiwan. The thickness and length of udon noodles are strictly regulated, and these standards are key to
creating their unique texture. Udon noodles are chewy, smooth, and easy to eat, providing a satisfying
sense of fullness, making them suitable for people of all ages. I love udon noodles because they are versatile and can be
cooked in many ways. no matter how they''re prepared, they taste great. Additionally, udon noodles are lower in calories
compared to other noodles, making them a lighter choice without the feeling of heaviness.
','Udon noodles can be enjoyed with a plethora of different spices and sauces. My personal favorite is shichimi togarashi,
which I recommend adding liberally to add a little more punch. Most Udon places will also have fried breading, add those too to really make the dish complete.

 (2,'barbeque','Simple methods, multiple flavors.','Barbecuing is one of the most ancient cooking methods. Despite its simplicity,
this way of cooking has evolved into diverse and rich dishes across various cultures. In Taiwan,
barbecuing became a Mid-Autumn Festival tradition due to a soy sauce company''s advertisement, giving
it a unique significance here. I enjoy barbecuing because grilling enhances the flavors of many
foods, and pairing grilled foods with different sauces allows me to taste a variety of flavors.','Barbecue can get really greasy if you eat it non-stop, so it is best to have some palate cleanser in between all the meats, like a salad,
ochazuke (rice soaked in tea), or some fruits, to wash off the greasy feel for a better experience.
As for the sauce, my personal go-to is barbecue sauce, egg yolk, and lemon juice.

(3,'Ramen','The chashu is the soul','When traveling in Japan, if I am burned out from all the walking, I just pop in at a station or some
                place along the road
                to eat a bowl of ramen, it makes me feel alive again. The broth, simmered with all kinds of meaty bones,
                the noodles with a uniquely chewy texture, and the smoky aroma unique to ramen shops make it incredibly
                satisfying. The chashu pork on top is the essence of the entire bowl. Somehow, the chashu is
                well-marinated and
                fatty but not greasy, it makes the whole bowl of noodles taste even better. By the way, I feel that the
                best ramen shops
                often appear in unassuming little alleyways.',
                'Ramen has deep and flavorful broth, but do not drink it all, even a few sips can be devastating to your health thanks to
its often high sodium and fat content. If you like heavy flavors, you can add garlic for a super flavor impact! Personally, I''m not a big fan.

(4,'matcha ice cream','and the red bean paste on the side','Because I am a matcha maniac, so everytime I went to kyoto I make sure to grab
                the famous Ujinotsuyu matcha, among the multiple matcha dessert, the one that speaks
                to me the most is the delightful matcha ice cream. its flavor is something else, with
                a thick matcha smell, you get a perfect balance of bitterness and sweetness, it is not an
                exaggeration that it is the peak of matcha. I was truely shaken to my core when I ate it.
','The matcha ice cream and the red bean paste should be eaten together. Both on their own are not that incredible,
but when you combine the two, it elevates the flavors of both flawlessly. Also, make sure to eat it slowly to avoid brain freeze and ruining the experience.

(5,'Donburi','Simple and approachable Japanese cuisine','Donburi is a general term for Japanese rice bowl dishes, consisting of a
                large bowl of rice topped with various simmered ingredients. Due to historical and cultural exchanges,
                donburi has also become a popular dish in Taiwan. Its affordable price makes it a common choice for
                students. I enjoy donburi because of its variety of toppings, and it can be paired with ingredients
                like green onions and cheese to enhance its texture. Its low price also allows me to enjoy Japanese
                cuisine at a minimal cost.',
                'There are two main ways people eat donburi: mixing the top ingredients with the rice below, or eating the top layer with the rice below.
I am personally a layer eater, but both methods are fun. If you can, pair it with some miso soup and try dipping the rice in the soup,
then eating it with the toppings. it''s my preferred way of eating donburi.

(6,'Pizza','Hawaiian pizza is amazing!','It is a traditional Italian delicacy that originated in Naples, Italy. The preparation involves a fermented round dough base, topped with a layer of 
tomato sauce, cheese, and other ingredients, then baked in an oven. Authentic 
Neapolitan pizza must be baked in a wood-fired dome oven, the dough must be handmade without the use of machinery, the pizza''s 
diameter must not exceed 35 cm, and the thickness at the center must not exceed 1/3 cm. As a Taiwanese, I understand pizza as a piece of dough on which you can add anything delicious, such as bubble tea or pineapple.',
'When eating pizza, because it''s relatively large, you can only eat it bite by bite. However, this may prevent you from experiencing the combined flavors of all the toppings. To solve this, you can fold the tip of the pizza towards the other end, roll it up, and take a bite. This way, you can enjoy the satisfaction of capturing the entire pizza''s taste in one mouthful.',

(7,'Pasta','White sauce pasta is so good!',
'It is a characteristic Italian food. Broadly speaking, pasta refers to noodle-like foods made from flour and water. There are many types of pasta, with the most common being spaghetti. Pasta comes in various sizes, from large to small, thick to thin, and includes shapes like strands, tubes, and other forms such as macaroni, fusilli, and lasagna. Pasta is very common in Taiwan, and you can find it in breakfast shops and convenience stores.',
'Since it often takes a long time to finish a single strand of pasta, I suggest breaking the noodles in half before cooking. This way, you don''t need to use as much force or take as long to eat one strand. Long noodles are suitable for pairing with tomato sauce, while tube pasta is great with meat sauce or cheese sauce.',

(8,'Dumplings','Filling wrapped in a thin dough skin','Foods called ''dumplings'' can be found all over the world. In East Asia, however, dumplings typically refer to a dish where a variety of meat and vegetables are combined into a filling and wrapped in a thin layer of dough. I love dumplings because they can be cooked in many ways—whether steamed, fried, or pan-fried, every method tastes amazing',
'Dumplings can be paired with different meat fillings, such as pork, beef, or shrimp. They can also be combined with various vegetables, such as chives, cabbage, or celery. Trying different cooking methods is also a great idea, such as boiling, pan-frying, steaming, or deep-frying.',
'ref/dumplings.jpg'),
(9,'Thick soup','Warm and thick, hearty soup','Thick soup achieves its rich consistency by using cornstarch to thicken the broth, with meat and vegetables added to the soup. There are many varieties of thick soup, with various meats and vegetables, and you can freely choose from a range of staple foods such as rice or noodles to pair with it. I love thick soup because it is very filling, and there are many different combinations to choose from.',
'You can choose meats such as pork, lamb, fish, or squid. For staples, you can opt for white rice, rice vermicelli, egg noodles, or flat rice noodles. You can also enhance the thick soup by adding seasonings like shacha sauce.',

(10,'Sushi','sushi? very beautiful very powerful',
'Sushi is a Japanese dish primarily made with vinegared rice seasoned with vinegar, sugar, and salt. The rice, typically Japanese pearl rice, is cooked and then cooled before being combined with various ingredients. While vinegared rice was initially used as a method of food preservation, it has evolved into a beloved culinary staple in Japan. Taiwanese sushi, in contrast to its traditional Japanese counterpart, may appear less refined but often boasts generous portions.',
'When enjoying sushi, it''s recommended to start with lighter flavors and gradually progress towards richer and heavier options. Concluding with a refreshing sushi allows you to fully appreciate the unique taste of each piece without overwhelming your palate. This way, you can savor every bit of the sushi experience.',
